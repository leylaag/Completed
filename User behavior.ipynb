For armor, more of the more expensive armor was bought. One note, the more expensive armor is 50% more than the cheaper armor. We may be able to raise the prie of the more expensive armor from $6 to $7, possibly and still be ok due to the demand. For the helmet, much more of the cheaper helmet was bought than the more expensive helmet, even though the price difference is just $3 compared to $4. Look into why, maybe the cheaper helmet is almost as good as the more expensive helmet? Maybe the solution would be to increase the ratings of the more expensive helmet so it becomes more desirable.\n",
